= g-leaflet Add-On project =

g-leaflet is a fresh start for GWT API for Leaflet. Integration 
should become lightweight using javascript overlays, but with 
small compromises with to API. Hoping this project to be/become 
as simple and clean as Leaflet itself.

There is also Leaflet.Draw API:
https://github.com/mstahv/g-leaflet-draw

Releases available via Vaadin Directory:
https://vaadin.com/directory/

== Usage ==

When using library, developer must first call 
LeafletResourceInjector.ensureInjected() (XSLinker compatible!)
that will injects required resources to your apps host page. 

Things should also work if one includes Leaflet into host page 
in other manners.

Manual and JavaDocs are not yet available (pathes wellcome!). API
should mimic actual Leaflet API quite a lot. Some hints can also 
taken from v-leaflet project (Vaadin Leaflet integration), that
has defined the initial feature set. Code for it might be in a 
branch initially.
